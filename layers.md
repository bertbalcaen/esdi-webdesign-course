# 3 layers in a webpage

A webpage contains 3 layers:

- HTML = structure and meaning
- CSS = design, appearance
- JavaScript = interaction

Each layer has a responsibility.

# HTML

- The bottom layer.
- The foundation on which everything else is built.
- This layer is all about structure, semantics, meaning.
- Use HTML to tell people and machines how a page is structured.

Examples:

- `<h1>` = this is the most important title
- `<h2>` = this is a subtitle
- `<p>` = just a paragraph

- HTML is very important for machines (software, computers):
- If HTML is used properly, a search engine (like Google) can understand the structure of the document. For example, if the search engine sees `<h1>` tags, it know that this text is important.

You can easily abuse HTML and use it for design. A classic bad example is using HTML tables to make columns in the page.

Don't use HTML for design, that's what CSS is for.

HTML is the most simple and most stable layer. It works in every browser. It's important to get this right.

# CSS

- CSS = aka 'stylesheets'.
- CSS determines what the page looks like.

CSS is not required to make a webpage. If you don't add a stylesheet yourself, the browser's default stylesheet will be used.

# JavaScript

- Used for interaction.
- For example: opening a popup, buttons, form validation, ...
