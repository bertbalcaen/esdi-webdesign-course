# Browsers

- Used to view webpages.
- Can do many more things: play back video and audio, 3D, realtime voice and video chat, ...
- Very complex and costly to develop.
- Only a few big companies like can afford to develop a browser: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Mozilla, ...

## Desktop

- Chrome
- Safari (Mac only)
- Firefox
- Chromium
- Edge (Windows only)
- Internet Explorer (Windows only)
- Opera (Windows + Mac)

Chrome dominates the desktop currently (almost 70% in 2020). Then come Safari and Firefox with each 8%. The rest is a mix of less popular browsers.

# Browser standards

- Not all browsers work the same way.
- 2 browsers can show the same page in a different way.
- Back in the 90's and 2000's, there were big problems with compatibility between browsers.
- Some sites only worked properly in a specific browser.
- An organization was formed: the Word Wide Web Consortium, the W3C. See https://www.w3.org.
- W3C is a non-profit organization, with representatives from all the companies that make browsers.
- W3C develops standards for browser technology.
- For example: HTML, CSS animations, ...
- A standard is just a theoretical description of how something is supposed to work.
- Then it still has to be implemented by browser makers.
- Not all browsers implement all the standards.
- Sometimes a browser implements only a part of a standard.
- New standards come out all the time.
- Some parts don't change very often, especially HTML, whereas other parts change all the time (JavaSCript for example).
- But: the situation now is much better than 10 years ago, thanks to standards.
- Accept the fact that a page will never look exactly the same in all browsers.
- Test your work in different browsers.
