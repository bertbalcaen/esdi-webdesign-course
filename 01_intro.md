# 3 layers in a webpage

A webpage is a cake with 3 layers:

- HTML = structure
- CSS = design
- JavaScript = interaction

Each technology has its responsibility.

TODO: show how to disable JS and CSS

# HTML

- The bottom layer.
- This layer is all about structure, semantics, meaning.
- Use HTML to tell people and machines how the page is structured.

Examples:

- `<h1>` = this is the most important title
- `<h2>` = this is a subtitle
- `<p>` = just a paragraph

HTML is very important for machines (software, computers):

- If HTML is used properly, a search engine (like Google) can understand the structure of the document. For example, if the search engine sees `<h1>` tags, it know that this text is important.

You can easily abuse HTML and use it for design. A classic bad example is using HTML tables to make columns in the page.

A good web designer never uses HTML for design.

# CSS

- CSS = aka 'stylesheets'.
- CSS determines what the page looks like.

CSS is not required to make a webpage. If you don't add a stylesheet yourself, the browser's default stylesheet will be used.

# JavaScript

- JS: used for interaction
- For example: animations, popups, form validation, ...
